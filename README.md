# Loan Status Prediction with Tensorflow
This repository contains code for a data science project that aims to predict the loan status of potential borrowers using historical data on loans given out by LendingClub, obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan, given historical data on loans and borrower information. This can help in assessing the likelihood of potential customers paying back their loans in the future. The project conducted feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python and evaluated model performance with TensorFlow, keeping in mind classification metrics.

## Data
The LendingClub dataset used in this project contains information on loans given out, including information on the borrower such as their credit score, employment length, and debt-to-income ratio. The dataset also contains information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off).

## Methodology
To build the loan status prediction model, the following methodology was employed:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and relationships
- Data cleaning and preparation for model training and testing
- Creation of a neural network model with TensorFlow
- Evaluation of model performance using classification metrics

## Results
The loan status prediction model was successfully built and evaluated, achieving a high accuracy rate in predicting loan status based on historical data. The findings from this project can be useful for financial institutions and loan providers in making data-driven decisions regarding loan approvals and risk assessment.
